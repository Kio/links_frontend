# Links

The application allows you to find all links that are on the entered URL. The application handles nested links with a depth less than 3.

From a technical point of view, the application consists of a [React frontend](https://github.com/Kio/links_frontend) and a [Django backend](https://github.com/Kio/links_backend).

## TODO

1. LinkContainedLinksTable component rewrite.
2. Tests
